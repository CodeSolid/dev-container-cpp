# A C++ Dev Container

This is a C++ VS Code Dev Container contained in a public GitHub repository.  Details of how I built this and used it locally in VS Code will follow in a [CodeSolid](https://codesolid.com) article soon.

I'll also be able to show how I was able to easily use this within GitHub CodeSpaces, by just following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository) plus adding a few customizations.
